Today, I went to the <place> with my best friend <name>.
We decided to <verb> as soon as we arrived.

First, we saw a <adjective> <animal> jumping on a <noun>.
It looked at us and made a <sound> sound.
We laughed so hard that <name> dropped their <object>.

Then, we ate some <plural_noun> and drank <liquid>.
Suddenly, a <color> <creature> flew over our heads,
shouting "<exclamation>!"

Before we left, I bought a <adjective> souvenir shaped like a <noun>.
It was the best day ever at the <place>.
